# DVC Project

A DVC project (or DVC repository) is a directory initialized by `dvc init`. It
contains [`.dvc` directory](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files),
`dvc.yaml` files that describe <abbr>pipelines</abbr> and `*.dvc` files for each
tracked data file. Files in <abbr>remotes</abbr> and <abbr>cache</abbr>, and
files like <abbr>metrics</abbr> and <abbr>plots</abbr> produced by DVC are also
considered part of the project.

Although it can used without a standard VCS or with alternative VCS's, a DVC
project _usually_ has a `.git` directory along with a `.dvc` directory. A DVC
project can be called a DVC repository to emphasize the presence of underlying
VCS. In most of the cases DVC project and DVC repository are synonyms.

_User facing_ part of a DVC project is referred as the <abbr>workspace</abbr>. A
DVC project can be considered as a superset of workspace.

`dvc root` returns the root directory of DVC project. As `dvc init` is used to
initialize a DVC project, `dvc destroy` can be used to remove all DVC related
<abbr>metafiles</abbr> from a directory.
