# Workspace

The workspace is the _user visible_ part of the directory that contains all your
project files e.g. raw datasets, source code, ML models, etc. Users work in this
directory with links of the data/model files that reside in <abbr>cache</abbr>
and manipulate the contents through DVC commands.

Files and directories in the workspace can be added to DVC (`dvc add`) or they
can be downloaded from external sources (`dvc get`, `dvc import`,
`dvc import-url`), changes to them can be tracked (`dvc commit`),
<abbr>pipelines</abbr> and <abbr>dependencies</abbr> between them can be defined
(`dvc run`), they can be sent to or retrieved from <abbr>remotes</abbr>
(`dvc push`, `dvc pull`) and can be removed (`dvc remove`, `dvc gc`) from the
workspace. DVC supports all typical operations of files and directories through
its commands.

Behind the scene these operations of a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> uses
<abbr>metafiles</abbr> to track the content and dependencies.
