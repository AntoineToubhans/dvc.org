# Metrics and Plots

<!-- _from plots and metrics intros_ -->

DVC has two concepts for metrics, that represent different results of machine
learning training or data processing:

1. `dvc metrics` represent **scalar numbers** such as AUC, _true positive rate_,
   etc.
2. `dvc plots` can be used to visualize **data series** such as AUC curves, loss
   functions, confusion matrices, etc.

<!-- _from `dvc metrics`_ -->

## Metrics

In order to follow the performance of machine learning experiments, DVC has the
ability to mark a certain stage <abbr>outputs</abbr> as metrics. These metrics
are project-specific floating-point or integer values e.g. AUC, ROC, false
positives, etc.

This type of metrics files are typically generated by user data processing code,
and are tracked using the `-m` (`--metrics`) and `-M` (`--metrics-no-cache`)
options of `dvc run`.

In contrast to `dvc plots`, these metrics should be stored in hierarchical
files.

## Plots

<!-- _from `dvc plots` description_ -->

DVC provides a set of commands to visualize certain metrics of machine learning
experiments as plots. Usual plot examples are AUC curves, loss functions,
confusion matrices, among others.

This type of metrics files are created by users, or generated by user data
processing code, and can be defined in `dvc.yaml` (`plots` field) for tracking
(optional).

In contrast to `dvc metrics`, these metrics should be stored as data series.
